[![Zero Hunger](https://www.wfp.org/sites/default/files/images/zerohunger_hero.jpg "Zero Hunger")](https://www.wfp.org/sites/default/files/images/zerohunger_hero.jpg)

- Every day too many men and women across the globe struggle to feed their children a nutritious meal. In a world where we produce enough food to feed everyone, **up to 811 million people still go to bed on an empty stomach each night.** Acute food insecurity affected **135 million people in 55 countries in 2019**. Even more – one in three – suffer from some form of malnutrition.

- Eradicating hunger and malnutrition is one of the great challenges of our time. Not only do the consequences of not enough – or the wrong – food cause suffering and poor health, they also slow progress in many other areas of development like education and employment.

- Hunger is the leading cause of death in the world. Our planet has provided us with tremendous resources, but unequal access and inefficient handling leaves millions of people malnourished.

- In 2015 the global community adopted the 17 Global Goals for Sustainable Development to improve people’s lives by 2030. **Goal 2 – Zero Hunger – pledges to end hunger, achieve food security, improve nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture,** and is the priority of the World Food Programme.

- In a research it was concluded that around 2 billion people are not having access to the proper food and 40% of food generated is being wasted.

- So we came up with **Hunger Reliever Project.** So that if we can reduce wastage of food by donating then we can reduce the Hunger for other people.
